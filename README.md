# DEVOPS BEGINNERS GUIDELINES
Devops engineer act as the link between development & operations hence the name devops.


As the devops you need to understand the following concepts:

How developers work.

Which git work flow

How application is configured

Automation testing


## Infrastructure
-> Knowledge of linux
-> Confortable using the linux CLI
-> Shell commands
-> Linux file system
-> Server management


## Networking & Security
-> Firewall & proxy servers
-> Load balancers
-> HTTPS/HTTP
-> IP/DNS

## Containers
-> Virtualizations
-> Docker

## Build automation & CI/CD
-> Build tools & Package manager i.e. maven, gradle & npm
-> Artifact repository i.e. nexus & docker hub
-> Build automation i.e. Jenkins connect to git repository(CI)
-> CD i.e. Notification to teams in case of the failure (handle failed deployments)

## Cloud providers
-> Learn atleast on cloud provider i.e. AWS

## Containers & Archestrations
-> Docker compose and docker swarm
-> Kubernetes i.e how to work, administer and manager k8s cluster

## Monitoring
-> You need to monitor the software and infrastructure
-> Track performance i.e. Nagios & Permistheous

## Infrastructure as code
-> Infrastructure provisioning
-> Configuration management
-> example using terraform, ansible or chef, puppet

## Scripting language
-> Automate the tasks for development and operations such as backups, cron jobs & system monitoring
-> Know scripting language such as os specific(power shell or bash), python[Most popular], ruby or golang

## Version control
-> Manage the scripting and automation code using git
